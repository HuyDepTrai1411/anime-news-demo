                <p><b><i>Synopsis:</i></b> In a civilized society of anthropomorphic animals, an uneasy tension exists between carnivores and herbivores. At Cherryton Academy, this mutual distrust peaks after a predation incident results in the death of Tem, an alpaca in the school's drama club. Tem's friend Legoshi, a grey wolf in the stage crew, has been an object of fear and suspicion for his whole life. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, he continues to lay low and hide his menacing traits, much to the disapproval of Louis, a red deer and the domineering star actor of the drama club.</p>
                <p>When Louis sneaks into the auditorium to train Tem's replacement for an upcoming play, he assigns Legoshi to lookout duty. That very night, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a white dwarf rabbit scorned by her peers. His growing feelings for Haru, complicated by his predatory instincts, force him to confront his own true nature, the circumstances surrounding the death of his friend, and the undercurrent of violence plaguing the world around him.</p>

            <div class="post_content review_content">
                <p>First, I'm gonna admit it: for the average viewer, there are BIG barriers to surpass before getting into Beastars. The greatest and most obvious one is of course the fact that characters are anthropomorphic animals, which by itself could be enough for many people to write this one immediately off in order to avoid the furry allegations. But even if you do try to watch it, you also have the fact that Beastars is fully CGI animated, something which might be off-putting to some. Add to the mix the openness in exploring otherwise conventional social themes in the context of a school campus life (including but not being limited to, SEXual life), in a setting however comprising of animal characters, which can make you uncomfortable, or dare I even say, CRINGE... all of which makes it completely normal for someone to say "that's too much" by the end of episode two (trust me, shit gets wild by that point).</p>
                <p>Getting past all of these, though, you might find yourself aptly rewarded: as I see it, Beastars is actually a show with plenty of thought put into it. It is a surprisingly interesting anime, involving engaging characters, a well thought-out world, amazing art and music by studio Orange, and many unique twists in your typical school life genre. I am not sure what my expectations were going into this, and while it is true that some, uhh... "scenes" were unbearably hard to watch, overall this ended up being a great experience (although season two is... slightly less great). It has many things to offer, many, many unique concepts, presented through the unconventional style of studio Orange.</p>
                <div class="post_img">
                    <img src="https://www.pluggedin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beastars.jpg">
                    <p class="caption">Teaser visual</p>
                </div>
                <p>In fact, this studio is probably what originally drew me into this show. Although some find this approach in animation weird, for me, it's so refreshing watching something so vastly different from your typical anime in terms of visuals. I had already watched Houseki no Kuni, so I kind of expected how things would look like: satisfying art direction, high quality on visuals, bright, vivid colors, even when forced to show a lot of white and various light hues due to the nature of this show. Music and sound effects are really good, another defining quality standard of Orange also observed in Houseki no Kuni. The first opening is legitimately one of the best I've ever seen and heard, a gorgeously cute stop-motion with an absolute jam of a song. And of course, the elephant in the room, CGI: I really liked it. It is fluid enough to make characters lifelike and vibrant, and clunky enough to separate them into fantasy, into a setting of anthropomorphic animals attending school.</p>
                <p>However, not all is perfect. Things do look kinda awkward when it comes to large, exaggerated gestures, like when some characters are surprised, or in some fight scenes. Sometimes, textures feel too plastic to be good. And as some point in other reviews, it does indeed stray quite a bit from the original artstyle of the manga (point in case, Haru). It's not without its flaws, but I enjoyed most of the assets studio Orange has to offer. It gives me the impression of a studio with actual professional artists working in it. So in technicality yes, it is still CGI, but it is NOT your typical CGI. Trust me, she's just different bro, I'm telling you.</p>
                <p>So, with that said, let's get into the meat and potatoes: story and characters. Having also read the rest of the manga, I have the full picture of this work. Overall, my feelings are... honestly, quite mixed. There are great things to point out in Beastars, for sure. The concept of having anthropomorphic characters by itself does not tell us much; it could simply be there just for the sake of being there. Beastars, however, actually expands on the concept of an animal society quite widely. It explores the idea of a mixed herbivore - carnivore civilization, with all of its intricacies and caveats: how do carnivores manage a civilized life together with herbivores? Who are the ones holding positions of power? Is there any discrimination? How is the law system adapted in an animal world? These are all questions this world strives to answer. At the beginning, Beastars starts out as an incubator world of just the Cherryton school, though later on, horizons are expanded as we slowly witness how the rest of society looks like. And there are many things to witness.</p>

                <p>Having not just one species of humans, but many many kinds of animal species, from zebras to komodo dragons, makes things much more complex and interesting. Not only does it make every character unique by default, through design alone, but every species also has their traits, both physical and social, and the writing always makes them relevant through one way or another. These aspects of Beastars shows that there is an obvious amount of research done here, and that's nice. That's world building, but what about the actual story and characters of this anime?</p>
